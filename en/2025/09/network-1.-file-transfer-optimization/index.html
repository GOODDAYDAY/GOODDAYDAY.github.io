They are usually represented in square brackets in tcpdump output. There are various flags in tcpdump output, and the output may also contain combinations of multiple TCP flags. Some common flags include: S (SYN): This flag is used to establish a connection between two hosts. It is set in the first packet of the three-way handshake. . (No flag): This means no flag is set in the packet. It is usually used for data transmission or acknowledgment packets. P (PUSH): This flag is used to indicate that the sender wants to send data as soon as possible without waiting for the buffer to fill. F (FIN): This flag is used to terminate the connection between two hosts. It is set in the last packet of the four-way handshake. R (RST): This flag is used to reset connections that are in an invalid state or encounter errors. It is also used to reject unwanted connection attempts. W (ECN CWR): This flag is used to indicate that the sender has reduced its congestion window size according to the network’s Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN). E (ECN-Echo): This flag is used to indicate that the receiver has received a packet with the ECN bit, meaning there is congestion in the network. For example, a packet with flags [S.] means it is a SYN packet, the first step in establishing a TCP connection. A packet with flags [P.] means it is a PUSH packet containing data that the sender wants to transmit quickly. A packet with flags [F.] means it is a FIN packet, the last step in closing a TCP connection. Why tcpdump Four-Way Handshake Only Has Three Packets The reason tcpdump four-way handshake only has three packets may be due to the following: One possibility is that the passive closing party (the one receiving FIN) sends its own FIN while replying with ACK, combining the second and third handshakes into one packet, saving one packet. In this case, the passive closing party has no more data to send, so it can directly enter the LAST_ACK state and wait for the final ACK from the active closing party. Another possibility is that the active closing party (the one sending FIN) doesn’t reply with ACK promptly after receiving the passive closing party’s FIN, but sends ACK after some time with the RST flag set, indicating a forced connection reset. In this case, the active closing party may have encountered an exception or timeout, so it no longer waits for the 2MSL time but directly enters the CLOSE state. Another possibility is that tcpdump didn’t capture all packets due to network delay or packet loss, causing certain handshake packets not to be captured. In this case, you can try re-capturing packets or increasing the capture time range to see if you can see the complete four-way handshake process.

Since all time jumps occur in packets returned from the server side, the problem is now very clear. Due to the actual physical distance between Shenzhen and the US East Coast, the 200ms round trip has reached its limit. So it’s actually reasonable.

Since all time jumps occur in packets returned from the server side, the problem is now very clear. Due to the actual physical distance between Shenzhen and the US East Coast, the 200ms round trip has reached its limit. So it’s actually reasonable. Soul-Searching Question At this point, a soul-searching question arises: why was it faster when using the public network before?

They are usually represented in square brackets in tcpdump output. There are various flags in tcpdump output, and the output may also contain combinations of multiple TCP flags. Some common flags include:<ul><li>S (SYN): This flag is used to establish a connection between two hosts. It is set in the first packet of the three-way handshake.</li><li>. (No flag): This means no flag is set in the packet. It is usually used for data transmission or acknowledgment packets.</li><li>P (PUSH): This flag is used to indicate that the sender wants to send data as soon as possible without waiting for the buffer to fill.</li><li>F (FIN): This flag is used to terminate the connection between two hosts. It is set in the last packet of the four-way handshake.</li><li>R (RST): This flag is used to reset connections that are in an invalid state or encounter errors. It is also used to reject unwanted connection attempts.</li><li>W (ECN CWR): This flag is used to indicate that the sender has reduced its congestion window size according to the network&rsquo;s Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN).</li><li>E (ECN-Echo): This flag is used to indicate that the receiver has received a packet with the ECN bit, meaning there is congestion in the network.</li></ul></li><li>For example, a packet with flags [S.] means it is a SYN packet, the first step in establishing a TCP connection. A packet with flags [P.] means it is a PUSH packet containing data that the sender wants to transmit quickly. A packet with flags [F.] means it is a FIN packet, the last step in closing a TCP connection.</li></ul><h4 id=why-tcpdump-four-way-handshake-only-has-three-packets>Why tcpdump Four-Way Handshake Only Has Three Packets</h4><ul><li>The reason tcpdump four-way handshake only has three packets may be due to the following:<ul><li>One possibility is that the passive closing party (the one receiving FIN) sends its own FIN while replying with ACK, combining the second and third handshakes into one packet, saving one packet. In this case, the passive closing party has no more data to send, so it can directly enter the LAST_ACK state and wait for the final ACK from the active closing party.</li><li>Another possibility is that the active closing party (the one sending FIN) doesn&rsquo;t reply with ACK promptly after receiving the passive closing party&rsquo;s FIN, but sends ACK after some time with the RST flag set, indicating a forced connection reset. In this case, the active closing party may have encountered an exception or timeout, so it no longer waits for the 2MSL time but directly enters the CLOSE state.</li><li>Another possibility is that tcpdump didn&rsquo;t capture all packets due to network delay or packet loss, causing certain handshake packets not to be captured. In this case, you can try re-capturing packets or increasing the capture time range to see if you can see the complete four-way handshake process.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id=actual-data>Actual Data</h3><div class=highlight><div class=chroma><table class=lntable><tr><td class=lntd><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code><span class=lnt>1

Obviously, the server received FIN packets. To explain this situation, through packet capture, we actually proved that the sister department&rsquo;s code issue caused FIN packets to be sent.</li><li>Since I highly value using packet capture and monitoring connection status to find problems, I planned to reproduce the previous situation to introduce packet capture tools and methods.

TCP window adaptation involves the following aspects:</strong></p><ol><li>Receive window: The number of bytes the receiver advertises to the sender that it can receive, used for flow control to prevent the sender from sending too fast and causing receiver buffer overflow.</li><li>Congestion window: The number of bytes the sender can send, maintained by the sender based on network congestion level, used for congestion control to prevent the sender from sending too fast and causing network congestion.</li><li>Sliding window: The number of bytes the sender can send, determined by the smaller value between the receive window and congestion window, used for sliding window protocol to ensure orderly and reliable data transmission.</li><li>Window scaling: A type of TCP header option used to extend the receive window size, allowing receivers to advertise window values exceeding 65535 bytes to adapt to high-speed networks.</li><li>Slow start: A congestion control algorithm used to initialize the congestion window to a small value (usually 1 MSS) after connection establishment or timeout retransmission, then increase the congestion window by 1 MSS for each received ACK, making the congestion window grow exponentially until reaching a slow start threshold (ssthresh) or packet loss occurs.</li><li>Congestion avoidance: A congestion control algorithm used after the congestion window reaches the slow start threshold, changing the congestion window to increase by 1 MSS per RTT, making the congestion window grow linearly until packet loss occurs.</li><li>Fast retransmit: A retransmission mechanism used to immediately retransmit lost segments after receiving three identical ACKs without waiting for timeout timer expiration.</li><li>Fast recovery: A congestion control algorithm used after fast retransmit occurs, setting the slow start threshold to half the current congestion window and setting the congestion window to the slow start threshold plus three MSS (corresponding to three duplicate ACKs), then entering the congestion avoidance phase.</li></ol><p><strong>What optimizations do connection pools provide?</strong></p><ol><li>Pre-create connections, reducing creation and destruction overhead when used.</li><li>Reuse connections, reducing connection creation and destruction itself.</li><li>Optimize transmission efficiency based on network protocols and current network conditions.</li></ol></div><div class=post-footer id=post-footer><div class=post-info><div class=post-info-line><div class=post-info-mod><span>Updated on 2025-12-06&nbsp;<a class=git-hash href=https://github.com/GOODDAYDAY/GOODDAYDAY.github.io/commit/af3d5c9bd409e602f90f3dec7c5441cd7924d96f target=_blank title="commit by haotian(865700600@qq.com) af3d5c9bd409e602f90f3dec7c5441cd7924d96f: Refactor Redis Cluster documentation for clarity and consistency">
